## Adaptability and Customization
We understand that every educational setting is unique, and so these materials are provided as flexible starting points. Educators are encouraged to adapt, extend, or modify these assignments to fit the specific needs and contexts of their students and learning objectives.

## Acknowledgment
These assignments were drafted with the help of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. The process of creating these resources demonstrates the practical use of AI as a brainstorming partner and teaching assistant. By leveraging AI in this way, educators can explore new pedagogical strategies and content ideas, making the teaching and learning experience more dynamic and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI technology.

## Emphasizing AI as a Collaborative Tool
The creation of this repository emphasizes the importance of using AI as a brainstorming partner and teaching assistant in developing educational assignments. AI technologies, when used responsibly and creatively, can be powerful tools in the hands of educators. They can assist in generating ideas, providing information, and even offering draft language that can be refined into learning materials. 

However, it's crucial to approach these tools with a critical eye, understanding their limitations and ensuring that the final educational content reflects accurate, ethical, and valuable learning for students. We encourage educators to engage with these AI-generated materials as a starting point for deeper exploration and customization.
