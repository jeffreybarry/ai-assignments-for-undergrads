 ### Assignment: Creating and Fine-Tuning a Simple Large Language Model Project

#### Description:
In this assignment, you will engage hands-on with Large Language Models (LLMs) by creating and fine-tuning a simple model using platforms like Google Colab and resources like open-source LLMs or the OpenAI API. You will select a small dataset of your choice, attempt to fine-tune the model for a specific task, and document the entire process, including any challenges faced and the outcomes achieved.

#### Learning Outcomes:
1. **Technical Proficiency**: Gain hands-on experience in setting up, fine-tuning, and working with LLMs.
2. **Critical Thinking**: Analyze and solve problems encountered during the model fine-tuning process.
3. **Project Documentation**: Effectively document the methodology, challenges, and results of your LLM project.
4. **Data Literacy**: Develop an understanding of how data selection and preprocessing impact model performance.

#### Assignment Tasks:
1. **Project Setup**: Choose an open-source LLM or use the OpenAI API and set up your project on Google Colab or a similar platform.
2. **Dataset Selection**: Select a small dataset appropriate for the task you aim to fine-tune the model on. Explain your choice and any preprocessing steps taken.
3. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Attempt to fine-tune the LLM using your selected dataset. Document the settings, parameters, and any modifications made during the process.
4. **Challenges and Problem-Solving**: Identify any challenges faced during the project and explain how you addressed them.
5. **Project Outcomes**: Evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model. Discuss the outcomes and any insights or surprises encountered during the project.
